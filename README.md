## William Drew and Clara Cousins

## NOTE: File paths may need to be changed for code to run correctly
## Input CSVs for the learn_dags_AS.R, AS_undirected.R, and tree_undirected.R, and tree_moreseparate_make_DAGs.R are contained within /143 data

## /Netflix vs Hulu
#### Contains files for current project

## /Netflix vs Hulu/AS_undirected.R
#### Code to run UGM structure learning algorithms on simulated traffic data from Internet Autonomous System network topology

## /Netflix vs Hulu/tree_undirected.R
#### Code to run UGM structure learning algorithms on simulated traffic data from random tree network topology

## /Netflix vs Hulu/directed.R
#### Preliminary code to calculate node degree

## /Netflix vs Hulu/learn_dags_AS.R
#### Code to run DAG structure learning algorithms on simulated traffic data from Internet Autonomous System network topology

## /Netflix vs Hulu/tree_moreseparate_make_DAGs.R
#### Code to run DAG structure learning algorithms on simulated traffic data from random tree network topology

## /Netflix vs Hulu/topo_generator.ipynb
#### Code to build random topologies and run network simulations. Generates csvs of network data. Also contains code to check trueness of found edges from generated graph from R (requires manual manipulation of text files).

## /Netflix vs Hulu/143 data
#### Contains some example simulated data csvs and text files containing edges found from R structure learning algorithms.

## /CAIDA
#### Contains files for abandoned direction of project using real world data from http://data.caida.org/datasets/topology/skitter/itdk/ITDK0204/IFF0204/all020319-27.run0404-07.iff

## /paper
#### Contains files for latex generation of paper
